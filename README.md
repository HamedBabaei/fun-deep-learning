# Fun Deep Learning
This is my repository for my works on Deep Learning Specialization course - I am going to make it more fun.

### Course 1: 

**Note**: Course label is **`Course1`** for tracking all changes for this week 

* Week 1: Intorductions
* Week 2: Logistic Regression as a Neural Network and Python Basics with Numpy. This week label is **`Course1-Week2`** for tracking the changes
     * loss function implementations `L1`, `L2` methods added. (`utils/loss.py`)
     * image utils `image2vector`, `display_image`, `flatten_X`, and `standardize_dataset` methods added. (`utils/image.py`)
     * activation functions `sigmoid` , `softmax`, and `sigmoid_derivative` methods added.(`utils/activation.py`)
     * base utils, `initialize_with_zeros` and `plot_cost_function` added. (`utils/base.py`)
     * dataloader utils for loading different datasets added.(`utils/dataloader.py`)
     * normalization methods `normalize_image` and `normalize_rows` methods added.(`utils/normalization.py`)
     * **LogisticRegression model with Neural Network mindset** a `logisticregression` directory with its own files added.
     * Dataset `dataset/catvnotcat` were used for this week added to dataset dir.
